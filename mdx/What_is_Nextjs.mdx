<MainHeading> What is Next.js?</MainHeading>

Next.js is a fullstack framework built on top of React.
This means you get all the power of React - components, hooks,
and everything you love - but with extra helpful features to help you
build fullstack web applications out of the box.

Next.js (usually pronounced NextJs) is used to create full-stack websites and web apps that are:
+ Fast
+ SEO-friendly
+ Easy to navigate
+ Scalable and secure

<Info>

In 2016, Guillermo Rauch, the founder of Vercel, introduced Next.js as 
a framework that would solve many of the challenges developers faced
with React.

At the time of it's debut, some may have said it's the next big thing. Maybe Others- "it's just the next
framework". Either way, it was <em>next</em> somehow. so what's more fitting
than calling it <em>"Next"</em>? <br/>
I still wonder what other names they considered... before settling on
the <em>next</em> one that came to mind - <strong>Next</strong>.

<MyH2>üõ†Ô∏è What Problem Does Next.js Solve?</MyH2>

Let's say you're using just React:
+ You have to build and configure your own routing system.
+ Page loading can feel slow because everything runs in the browser.
+ Backend features are not built in, instead you have to make requests using 
the useEffect hook to external backend services.

With NextJs you get all the benefits of the React framework and more out of the box:
+ A flexible, easy-to-maintain routing system
+ improved perfomance since the server handles most of the heavy lifting
+ Backend for your React frontend (within the same application). 
+ SEO features included too e.g automatic image optimization, making sure you nest your tags properly (accessibilty) and more.

<MyH2>Summary</MyH2>

Next.js is a powerful React-based framework that helps you build fast,
SEO-friendly, and scalable websites - with less stress.

It takes care of several (if not all) of the behind the scenes stuff that you would 
have to worry about when using just React. And the cherry on top - Next.js is open-source and it's easy to maintain.
