<MainHeading> A Little History (with a very unnecessary pun 🙈)</MainHeading>

In 2016, Guillermo Rauch, the founder of Vercel, introduced a new
framework that aimed to solve many of the challenges developers faced
with React.
And what did he call it?, Next.js - as in "the next step" in building modern web apps.

Some say it was the next big thing. Others say it was just the next
framework. Either way, it's "next" somehow - so what's more fitting
than calling it Next?

I still wonder what other names they considered... before settling on
the next one that came to mind - Next.

Me: Did you see what I did there?

Probably you: (🙄 ... brother please stop).

<H2>🚀 So, What is Next.js?</H2>

Next.js is a framework built on top of React.

This means you still get all the power of React - components, hooks,
and everything you love - but with extra helpful features included out
of the box.

Think of it like your big brother who just came back home and suddenly
made everything easier and better. 😎

Next.js is created and maintained by a company called Vercel.

With Next.js, you can build full-stack websites and web apps that are:
• Fast
• Search engine friendly
• Easy to navigate
• Scalable and secure

<H2>🛠️ What Problem Does Next.js Solve?</H2>

Let's say you're using just React:
- It's harder to make your site show up well on Google (poor SEO).
- You have to build and configure your own routing system.
- Page loading can feel slow because everything runs in the browser.
- Backend features are not built in.

Now here's how Next.js solves those problems:

  ------------- -------------
  Poor SEO                            Supports Server-Side Rendering
                                      (SSR) so Google can "see" your
                                      content.

  No routing                          Has built-in file-based routing -
                                      just create a file, and it becomes
                                      a page.

  Slow load time                      Supports Static Site Generation
                                      (SSG) and image optimization.

  No backend features                 Comes with built-in API routes for
                                      server-side functions.

SEO-friendly, and scalable websites - with less stress.
