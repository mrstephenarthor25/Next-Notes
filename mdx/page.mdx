Before we talk about Next.js, let's take a quick step back.

Websites are like buildings on the internet. While some buildings are
small and simple - maybe just one or two rooms for mum, dad, and the
kids, others are big and complex, with many rooms and features - a
garage, swimming pool, or bar and many more features.

In the same way, some websites have only one or two simple pages that
don't need much processing, while others, made up of so many pages, need several tools and systems
working together to function properly.

To build websites, developers often use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But
as websites became more complex, developers needed tools that could help
them build faster, better, and more powerful websites efficiently.

That's where frameworks like Vue, React, Svelte, and Next.js (among many
others) come in.

These frameworks bring all the necessary tools together so you can focus
on what matters most- building the website.
