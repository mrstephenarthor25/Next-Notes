Thank you for taking your time to go through my very first note on Next.js.

Did you like it? <br/>
I built this platform to exlain Next.js
in a way that is easy to learn and follow along with (especially for React developers who have little to no experience with backend).
I'm a RILT stack Developer who is also learning Next.js. so I document my learing process in a way that makes it
easier for another learner like myself to learn Next.JS step by step.

I intend adding at least 8 notes every week. I might adjust the frequency based on my 
schedule, but i'll be sure to keep learning and keep posting!

Thank you once again
