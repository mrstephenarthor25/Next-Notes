Now that you understand what Next.js is and why it's needed, let's see how to 
create a Next.Js app.

While a Next.Js app can be created manually, the easiest and recommended way is to use a 
tool called <em>create-next-app</em>.<br/>This tool sets up everything for you so you don't have to worry about manual configurations.  Instead, you can  start coding almost immediately!

<MyH2>Installation</MyH2>

Before you create your Next.Js app, let's make sure your device meets the system requirements.
To be able to create a Next.js app using the latest version of Next.Js, you'll need:

+ Node version 18.18 or newer
+ Windows, Linux or MacOs operating System.

<System button_text="Check my device">
    <small className="block">Software check</small>
</System>
</MySection>

<MySection>

<MyH2>Let's Create your Next.JS app</MyH2>

+ open your terminal and run the command (Ps: internet connection is required):
<TerminalBLock text={"npx create-next-app@latest"}/>

<Tip>
    npx comes with Node.js so no extra installation needed
</Tip>

+ You would be asked the following questions to proceed with the installation:

<CodeBLock lang="bash" title="Create-next-app prompts" >
    What is your project named? #enter name of project without space
    Would you like to use Typescript? (Yes/No) #yes
    Would you like to use Eslint? (Yes/No) #yes
    Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? (Yes/No) #yes
    Would you like to use src/ directory? (Yes/No) #No
    Would you like to use App Router? (Yes/No) #yes
    Would you like to customize the default import alias(@/*)? (Yes/No) #yes
</CodeBLock>

<Tip>
    + As a React developer, there is a very high chance you already know
    what each prompt is refering to. 
    If there's any prompt asked that you're not sure of, most likely that would be 
    <em>"Would you like to use App Router?"</em> <br/>
    Please choose "yes" for now, we'll talk about it later. so don't worry if it doesn't make sense now.

    + These lessons use a little Typescript. if you're not familiar, don't worry i'll give quick explanations along the way- just click on the <TypeScriptDesc/> button to view the explanation.
</Tip>

Once the installation is complete:

<CodeBLock title="Move into to the Nextjs app directory" lang="bash">
    cd [my-app-name]
</CodeBLock>
<br/>
Replace <em>[my-app-name]</em> with the name of your project.

Finally:
<CodeBLock title="Start the development server" lang="bash">
    npm run dev
</CodeBLock>
<br/>
<br/>
After starting the server, you can open your Next.js App on <br/>
http://localhost:3000/ (copy and paste the url in your browser)
<br/>
<br/>

<TextInImage src={congrats_image} alt="Congratulations on creating your Next.js app" text={"Congratulations on creating your Next.js application"}/>

<MyH2>Summary</MyH2>

You've successfully created you Next.js app.<br/>

+ You saw how the create-next-app tool guided you through the process
+ You selected options like App Router and Typescript (don't worry if these are new, we'll talk about them later )
+ You've successfully started your Next.js app locally
+ Well done!

Think of this as building a house. You've set the foundation. From here, we can start shaping this into something amazing.
<br/>

Next, let's understand the project structure of your just created Next.js app.
