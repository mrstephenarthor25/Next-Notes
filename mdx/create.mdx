<MainHeading> How to Create a Next.Js App</MainHeading>

Now that you understand what Next.js is and why it's needed, let's see how to 
create a Next.Js app.

While a Next.Js app can be created manually, the easiest and recommended way is to use a 
tool called <em>create-next-app</em>.<br/>This tool sets up everything for you so you dont have to worry about manual configurations but instead  
start coding almost immediately!

<MyH2>Installation</MyH2>

Before you install NextJs, let's make sure your device meets the system requirements.
To be able to install the latest version of Next.Js you'll need:
+ Node version 18.18 or newer
+ Windows, Linux or MacOs operating System.

If you're not sure wether your device meets these requirements you can <button>Check your device here </button> 


<MyH2>Let's Creat your NextJS app</MyH2>

+ open your terminal and run the command (Ps: internet connection is required):
<TerminalBLock text={"npx create-next-app@latest"}/>

<Tip>
    npx comes with Node.js so no extra installation needed
</Tip>

+ You would be asked the following questions to proceed with the installation:

<CodeBLock lang="bash" title="Create-next-app prompts" >
    What is your project named? #enter name of project without space
    Would you like to use Typescript? (Yes/No) #yes
    Would you like to use Eslint? (Yes/No) #yes
    Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? (Yes/No) #yes
    Would you like to use src/ directory? (Yes/No) #No
    Would you like to use App Router? (Yes/No) #yes
    Would you like to use customize the default import alias(@/*)? (Yes/No) #yes
</CodeBLock>

<Tip>
    + As a React developer, there is a very high chance you already know
    what each prompt is refering to. 
    If there's any propmt asked that you're not sure of, most likely that would be 
    <em>"Would you like to use App Router?"</em> <br/>
    Please just answer "yes" for now, we'll talk about it in another note

    + These lessons assumes you know Typescript (at the basic level at least). If you don't,
    Please consider taking a crash course on it. You could do so now or at another time, but please make
    sure you do so.
    Typescript is becoming more of a standard for production ready applications. 
</Tip>

Once the installation is complete:

<CodeBLock title="Move into to the Nextjs app directory" lang="bash">
    cd [my-app-name]
</CodeBLock>
<br/>
<em>my-app-name</em> should be replaced with the name of your project.

Finally:
<CodeBLock title="Start the development server" lang="bash">
    npm run dev
</CodeBLock>
<br/>
<br/>
After starting the server, you can open your Next.js App on <br/>
http://localhost:3000/ (copy and paste the url in your browser)
