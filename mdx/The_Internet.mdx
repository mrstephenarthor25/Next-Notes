<MainHeading>The Internet and Websites</MainHeading>

Before we talk about Next.js, let's take a quick step back.

Websites are like buildings on the internet. Just as some buildings are
small and simple  maybe just one or two rooms for mum, dad, and the
kids  others are big and complex, with many rooms and features like a
garage, swimming pool, or bar.

In the same way, some websites have only one or two simple pages that
don't need much processing, while others need several tools and systems
working together to function properly.

To build websites, developers often use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But
as websites became more complex, developers needed tools that could help
them build faster, better, and more powerful websites.

That's where frameworks like Vue, React, Svelte, and Next.js (among many
others) come in.

These frameworks bring all the necessary tools together so you can focus
on what matters most  building the website.

What is React? (Quick Reminder)

Created by Facebook, React is a tool that helps developers build
websites using small, reusable parts called components.

A component could be a button, a section, a header  anything you
want. With components, every single element on a webpage can be managed
on its own without affecting the others.

Even better, when something on the page needs to change or reload, only
that specific part is updated  not the whole page. This makes your
website faster and more efficient.

However, React only works in the browser. By itself, it doesn't handle:
 Routing (moving efficiently from one page to another)
SEO (making the website friendly to search engines like Google)
Backend tasks like reading from a file or connecting to a database

To handle those, you'd usually have to use external services or do more
manual setup.

But thankfully, things were about to change...
