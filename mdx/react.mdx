Created by Facebook, React is a tool that helps developers build
websites using small, reusable parts called components.
A component could be a button, a section, a header  anything you
want. 

With components, every single element on a webpage can be managed
on its own without affecting the others.
Even better, when something on the page needs to change or reload, only
that specific part is updated, not the whole page. This makes your
website faster and more efficient.

However, React only works in the browser. By itself, it doesn't handle:
 - Routing (moving efficiently from one page to another)
 - SEO (making the website friendly to search engines like Google)
 - Backend tasks like reading from a file or connecting to a database

To handle those, you'd usually have to use external services or do more
manual setup.

But thankfully, things were about to change...
